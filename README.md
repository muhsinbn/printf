The `printf` function, short for “print formatted,” is a fundamental function in the C programming language. It is part of the standard input/output library (`stdio.h`) and is primarily used for outputting formatted text on the console or screen. With `printf`, you can display various data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings, in a well-structured manner.
